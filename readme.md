# My implementation of the nand2tetris projects

All the projects are completed and tested. As of 02.2022, they're fully functioning. To run any of them, you will need the [Nand2Tetris softwaire suite](https://www.nand2tetris.org/software).

I followed the (freely available) Nand2Tetris Coursera courses as well as the second edition of the book *The Elements Of Computing Systems* from 2021 by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken.

The projects which involve a freely chosen programming language (7,8,10,11) are written in Rust.

Warning: a lot of the code here is written at 4 am, badly commented and not very readable. It still might be useful if you're trying to go through the course on your own and facing some issues (the only repo with all the projects completed that I've found is from 2012 and is now outdated). Feel free to use this however you want to.
